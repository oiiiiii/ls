# Additional skills in incremental learning

## Recognizing unsuitable texts

Best articles for [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) are fact-rich and context-rich. You need to develop your own rules for selecting quality reading material. Nothing can substitute for your own experience. You will learn to identify texts that are hard to process and yield lower reading efficiency.

Let's consider two extremes:

- **Wikipedia**: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) is great because it is crowd-sourced and many authors edit only a small section of a text in total abstraction of the rest of the article. This is why even a small portion of the text (as in [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading)) will usually contain all relevant context
- **Fiction**: Fiction is best read linearly and you can just use a paper bookmark in a paper book to do as well as you would do with [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading)

Many articles fall in between [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) and fiction extremes. Where [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) would say "the http protocol", a typical article might just say "the protocol" (if "the" is clear from preceding passages). Some text are peppered with "as I mentioned in the previous chapter", or "go to the next section", or "the three points explained in the previous chapter", etc. Abuse of working memory in text writing makes [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) difficult. This means that if authors use a lot of "referential ambiguity", the texts are not good for [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading). Example ambiguity keywords: "the", "they", "he", "it", etc.

Many articles are also filled with irrelevant chaff ([super-memory.com](http://super-memory.com/) isn't impervious to that weakness). Too much beating about the bush without clearly stating the conclusions that are most important to the reader. "Speculative philosophy" might be a good inspirational read, but probably not for [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading). You need to decide.

Some narratives should just best be read passively. They may be a compilation of facts that are generally obvious. In such cases you can just read and [dismiss](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss). Or you can read and schedule another review in a month or in a year (if you worry you miss something important). Or you can try to write, in your own words, a sentence or two on what new things you have learned from the narrative. Your sentence would shortly extract the quintessence from an otherwise lengthy passage. If it is meaningful and quintessential, you shall find little trouble with locating keywords suitable for [clozing](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion).

You need to develop your own rules for deciding which articles are good for reading. The chief rule might be: import anything that looks interesting, start reading, and if you recognize tell-tale problems, just deprioritize or delete or fish for a few highlights and then delete.

Remember that you need to differentiate between [unsuitable texts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Example:_Unsuitable_texts) and [difficult texts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Handling_incomprehensible_articles).

## Handling incomprehensible articles

In [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), you will often encounter material that is difficult to understand. You will need to develop analytical skills that will help you identify the reasons for the difficulties. If the culprit is the author, delete the article. If you need to digest other pieces of your [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) first, delay the article. If you need more knowledge, delay the article and import more knowledge that will be needed to boost understanding. Do not forget that **some texts make an inherently poor material for [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading)** (e.g. descriptions of scientific experiments, mathematical derivations, programming examples in source code, case studies, etc.). In such cases, use traditional methods of thorough analysis, summarize results of your analysis, and use SuperMemo to keep track of your own summaries. See: [Recognizing unsuitable texts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Recognizing_unsuitable_texts) (incl. [example](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Example:_Unsuitable_texts)).

This is how you can approach complexity in [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading):

1. Start reading the article from the top. Once you find a difficult fragment, analyze it, and diagnose the reasons for your comprehension problems
2. If the rest of the article does not depend much on the difficult fragment, extract it, and keep on reading
3. If the rest of the article cannot be understood without understanding the difficult fragment choose one of the following:
   - if you need more knowledge to understand the fragment: postpone the article (**[Learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Learning) : [Reschedule](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Reschedule)** from the [element menu](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu) or *Ctrl+J*)
   - if the fragment is hopelessly intricate and leaves no hope for the future (e.g. because of wrong grammar, wording, formulation, logic, etc.), delete the article, and search for alternative material
4. If you decide to postpone the article with *Ctrl+J*, decide what new knowledge you will need before getting back to the difficult fragment. List dictionary entries, encyclopedia articles, articles on the net that you will need to process before going any further. Schedule the search for materials as separate [topics](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) or try to search for new knowledge instantly
5. Estimate the earliest time when you hope you will be able to understand the difficult article and use the appropriate [interval](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) with *Ctrl+J*. If the article includes high priority knowledge, it is always better to err on the safe side and provide a too early review

## Randomizing repetitions

You can execute [outstanding repetitions](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_material) in a [subset](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Subset). If you would like to use a random sequence, follow these steps:

1. open the [element subset](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Subset) in the [browser](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser)
2. choose **[Random](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu#Random) : Randomize browser** on the [browser menu](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu) (*Shift+Ctrl+F11*)
3. choose **[Learn](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu#Learn)** on the [browser menu](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu) (*Ctrl+L*)

## Read toolbar

You can display the **Read** toolbar by clicking the **Read** tab at the bottom of the [element window](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_window) (at **Middle** or higher [level](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Level)).

[![SuperMemo: The Read toolbar at the bottom of the element window. It features options used in incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/images/thumb/5/5b/Read_toolbar.jpg/800px-Read_toolbar.jpg)](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Read_toolbar.jpg)

> ***Figure:** The [**Read** toolbar](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Read_toolbar) at the bottom of the [element window](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_window). It features options used in [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading)*

### Toolbar buttons

- **Paste article** (*Ctrl+N*) - paste a new article from the clipboard to the current [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection)

- **Remember extract** (*Alt+X*) - use the selected part of the text to create a new [element](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element) and introduce this new element into the learning process. This is one of the most important options used in [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading). Use *Alt+X* on a selected text to tell SuperMemo that the selection is important and that you want to better remember it in the future

- **Schedule extract** (*Shift+Alt+X*) - use the selected text to create a new [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) and schedule its [review](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Review) on a selected day with a selected [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority). **Schedule extract** is the same as **Remember extract** but you can manually select the first [interval](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval), [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority), and more

- Remember cloze

   

  (

  Alt+Z

  ) - create a new

   

  cloze deletion element

   

  based on the current keyword selection and introduce that new

   

  element

   

  into the learning process

  > **Example**: You can convert the following sentence:
  >
  > > *In 1947 the UN voted to divide Palestine into Arab and Jewish states*
  >
  > to question:
  >
  > > *In 1947 the UN voted to divide Palestine into Arab and **[...]** states*
  >
  > by:
  >
  > 1. selecting the word *Jewish* and
  > 2. choosing **Cloze** (or pressing *Alt+Z*).

  In addition to **Extract** ([above](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#extract)), this is the most important option of [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading).

- **Schedule cloze** - create a new [cloze deletion](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) and schedule it for [repetition](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Repetition) on a selected day

- **Task extract** - use the selected part of the text to create a new [task element](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Task) and put this element on the current [tasklist](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Tasklist)

- **Split article** - split the article into multiple [topics](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) using various chapter markers such as headlines, horizontal lines, Wikipedia sections, [SuperMemo splitmarks](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Splitmark), etc. This can substantially accelerate decomposition of very long articles and prioritization of article chapters

- **[E-mail](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_mail_processing)** (*Shift+Ctrl+E*) - send the [element](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element) or the selected text via e-mail (you can annotate the [element](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element) or comment on the selected text)

- **[E-mail FAQ](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_mail_processing#Responding_with_FAQs)** - use the selected text as the basis of an FAQ question, and send the answer to the question's author. Your response will automatically be added to an FAQ file of your choice. It can also produce a Wiki version. All FAQs at SuperMemo Website have been created by means of **E-mail FAQ**. Many FAQs at [SuperMemoPedia](https://supermemopedia.com/) have been created using this option as well

- **Highlight** - highlight the currently selected text

- **Change highlight style** - change the highlight style (i.e. font, font style, font size, font color, and text highlight color)

- **Ignore** (*Shift+Ctrl+I*) - ignore the selected text in reading by marking it with the *ignore* style

- **Delete before cursor** (*Alt+\*) - delete texts before the cursor (e.g. after processing it)

- **Delete after cursor** (*Alt+.*) - delete texts after the cursor (e.g. footnotes, external links, literature references, etc.)(SuperMemo references located at the bottom of the text are not affected)

- **Set read-point** (*Ctrl+F7*) - mark the selected text as the point from which you will resume reading the next time you return to the presented article. In [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), you rarely need to use **Set read-point** as all extract, cloze, highlight, and other operations will automatically set the read-point for you

- **Go to read-point** (*Alt+F7*) - go to the text that has been selected as the read-point

- **Clear read-point** (*Shift+Ctrl+F7*) - remove the read-point from the currently processed text

## One memory, one action

In [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), you achieve highest efficiency if your process knowledge in small steps separated in time. This way you can accomplish a good memory effect at little processing effort. However, many users fall into traps of inefficiency where too little or too much work is done on a subject in a single review.

### Futile review

Futile review is an example of insufficient work done (one action, zero memory). Futile review is born in this mental scenario: you see a [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) and think: *I am in no mood for this material now. Let's execute **Next repetition**.* This is wrong! You must take action or you will loop into wasting time and learning little! It is a cardinal sin to execute processing operations without actually learning anything. When a [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) arrives, you may have a dozen of excuses: "*I do not like this one. Let's do it tomorrow*". Or "*I am too sleepy for this one*". Or "*This one will take too much time.*" If you find yourself in a loop and constantly rescheduling the same [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic), or spending time rescheduling a number of [topics](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic), you are hurting the efficiency of learning! This is the time that could be spent on more productive steps.

If you do not want [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) to become a waste of time, you must **always take some action** when you see a [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic). For example:

- read a sentence and delete it, or mark as *ignore*, or extract it
- if the article is not vital for your further progress, set low [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) (e.g. 99%)
- for the material that you won't have time for in a month or more, set the [interval](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) (e.g. to 333 days)

In other words, either make tiny inroads into the text, or mark it clearly as low priority or to-be-done later. Consider also **[Delete](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Delete_element)** or **[Done!](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Done)**

### Item perfectionism

Another facet of the same problem is taking too many actions on a single piece of information. It is highly inefficient to work on colors, fonts, pictures, [priorities](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority), etc. during a single repetition. All those actions can be spread over time. Naturally, setting the right [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) is one of the most important steps. Perhaps a piece of information is not important enough to ever squeeze through your crowded learning. If so, you will save tons of time on not doing colors and styles.

Here also you should remember: **one memory, one action**. Each time you review a piece of information, you are allowed to do an edit, font change, template change, concept group change, etc. However, unless you can do all your actions in a single burst of machine gun keyboard strikes, or unless some actions are associated with learning new things, you should rather limit your actions to a single step per single repetition.

**One memory, one action** rule demands that **every operation in incremental learning should leave a trace in your memory**. It also says that **one operation on a piece of data is better than two operations at the same time**

### Example: incremental item structuring

The following [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) may look like a violation of the [20 rules](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation):

> **Question**: Inflammation is produced by [eicosanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid) and [cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine). Eicosanoids include (1) [prostaglandins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin) that produce [fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever) and [vasodilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilator), and (2) **[...]** that attract certain [white blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell)
> **Answer**: [leukotrienes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene)

However, the [20 rules](https://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm) were written in 1999 for classical SuperMemo. Incremental learning is incremental across the spectrum of rules and principles. In particular, formulating [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) and building understanding are incremental too.

According to the **one memory, one action** principle, the presented [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) will assume its final shape some time in the undefined future (or never, if its [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) is not high enough). It must be processed incrementally due to the following factors:

1. incremental build up of comprehension, and
2. incremental reformulation that requires time.

The [20 rules](https://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm) say "**Do not memorize until you understand**", however, understanding is also an incremental process. Converting this [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) to plain "*What eicosanoids attract white blood cells?*" might make sense only if the student fully understands and remembers the hierarchy of inflammation factors, and involved eicosanoids. If this is not the case, carrying the context in the shape of this complex [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) is a form of transitional stage between a [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) and an [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item). The [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) still asks the question vital for [active recall](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall). However, it also makes sure that full context is provided until the rest of the knowledge structure is firmly established in student's mind. In [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), the order of reading is often chaotic, the understanding is incremental, and the effort to build a solid knowledge structure is gradual too.

In addition to the incremental buildup of comprehension, extensive edits of [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) are costly (esp. a total rewrite of the item to a plain question). In fact, one of the main advantages of [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) is the minimum need for typing. This is why we use electronic sources in the first place (instead of just books that offer no disadvantage when entire [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) are typed in anyway). This is why an important efficiency principle in incremental learning is to minimize edits by complying with the **one memory, one action** principle.

Let us see how the presented [item](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) might evolve in successive repetitions. Note that all edit steps my proceed only with solidification of related knowledge (i.e. a single repetition may actually bring no edits at all). The execution of those steps will also be somewhat dependent on item [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority). High priority items will receive more exposure, more processing and will demand better formulation quality.

## Learning lists

Lists and sets are difficult to remember. It is hard to remember the whole set of countries that belong to the European Union. When learning lists, you should rather decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.

Let us consider an example in which you want to memorize the entire sequence of letters in the alphabet. It won't be very effective if you use the following item:

> **Question**: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet?
> **Answer**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

You will notice that you frequently stumble on parts of the sequence and need to stop repetitions just to exercise the entire sequence in the traditional way (like we all learn poems by rote).

However, you can approach this in a way that guarantees quick effects:

> **Question**: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between A and E?
> **Answer**: A, B, C, D, E

> **Question**: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between D and H?
> **Answer**: D, E, F, G, H

> **Question**: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between G and K?
> **Answer**: G, H, I, J, K

> etc. etc.

After 2-3 weeks of repetitions, you may take on an extra task of recalling the whole sequence after each repetition of these simplified [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item). This will make sure you can recite the entire alphabet quickly. You will also frequently rehearse that parts of the sequence that are harder for your memory (e.g. *V, W, X, Y, Z*) as opposed to those that are much simpler (e.g. *A, B, C, D, E*).

### Practical problems with memorizing lists

You may develop a good methodology for memorizing lists in SuperMemo. However, you may later discover that the memorized lists are not very useful in real life, or worse, your memory may fail you when you undergo a baptism of fire. You already know that list should not form an answer to a question. In a list A, B, C, SuperMemo needs to separately understand your difficulties with linking A and B, B and C, etc. You can use [cloze deletion](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) to learn lists using multiple [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item). For example:

**Parent template [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic)/[extract](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract):**

> A B C

[Items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) generated with [cloze deletion](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion):

**Item 1:**

> **Question**: **[...]** B C
> **Answer**: A

**Item 2:**

> **Question**: A **[...]** C
> **Answer**: B

**Item 3:**

> **Question**: A B **[...]**
> **Answer**: C

It is important to know that **Item 1** above may make you fail to answer with A to the question C if you only learn to answer **Item 1** by understanding the association of B with A. In such cases, you will need even more work by formulating [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item): A-B (where A is the question and B is the answer), A-C, B-A, B-C, C-A, and C-B. Although you will get six [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) instead of one, you knowledge is likely to be more solid and you may actually spend less time on repetitions of those multiple [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) than on repetitions of the conglomerate A-B-C item

### Lists can often be ignored

In a majority of cases, we do not need to learn lists at all. The perception that a list is worth memorizing is often a reflection of a bad habit we bring from school where lists are a frequent feature at exams.

A user of SuperMemo asked: "*Could you please help me with extracting [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) from the following text? I am really not sure where to mark the boundaries of [extracts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract) and how to use [cloze deletion](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion)?*":

> *Changing Rates of Mental Illness*
>
> *Mental illness is becoming an increasing problem for two reasons. First, increases in life expectancy have brought increased numbers of certain chronic mental illnesses. For example, because more people are living into old age, more people are suffering from dementia. Second, a number of studies provide evidence that rates of depression are rising throughout the world*

This fragment is difficult to process because it is an enumeration (a list) that forms one large logical structure. However, for understanding the subject, you do not really need to remember how many factors affect mental illness. You primarily need to remember the relationship between the cause and the effect. If you ignore the enumeration, you can simply produce the following [topics](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic) that will each be easy to process further:

> - *Mental illness is becoming an increasing problem*
> - *Increases in life expectancy have brought increased numbers of certain chronic mental illnesses*
> - *Because more people are living into old age, more people are suffering from dementia*
> - *Rates of depression are rising throughout the world*

If you believe that you cannot live without the enumeration, you can first extract the facts listed above, and then simplify the enumeration by deleting all superfluous information:

> *Mental illness is increasing for 2 reasons:*
>
> 1. *increases in life expectancy have brought increased chronic illnesses*
> 2. *rates of depression are rising*

### Using Decompose

Little known but very useful function in SuperMemo can help you tackle lists.

If you are learning the names of fruits, you might see a text like this:

> *Examples of fruits are apples, oranges, pears, cherries, banana...*

You do not want to memorize the whole list of fruits, esp. that the longer it gets the more likely you are to fail. There is no definite or complete list of fruits that would make a good memorization target. All you really want to know is that an apple is a fruit, or an orange is a fruit, etc. The list itself is rather useless. You can keep it as a reference in SuperMemo, but memorizing it would be a waste of time.

You can use **[Decompose](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Decompose)** to quickly achieve your learning goals in reference to fruits. Start from modifying the [topic](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic):

> *Apples, oranges, pears, cherries, banana ... are fruits.*

Generate a template [cloze](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion):

> **Question**: Apples, oranges, pears, cherries, banana are **[fruits/vegetables]**
> **Answer**: fruits

Convert that [cloze](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) to a version that can easily be decomposed by placing list members into braces using slashes as separators:

> **Question**: {apples/oranges/pears/cherries/banana} are **[fruits/vegetables]**
> **Answer**: fruits

You can now treat the question field with **[Reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reading) : [Decompose](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Decompose)** on the [component menu](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu) to get a series of [clozes](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) like these:

## Thorough preview of articles

It is hard to formulate a simple algorithm for deciding when to preview the whole article before reading, and/or when to extract the most important fragments during a preview. After all, the article can also be read incrementally in a linear sequence. This is a case a multi-criterial optimization where many factors must be taken into account and the ultimate decision will depend on your own preferences.

Here are some criteria:

- if you need this knowledge today, you should start with a quick preview and extracting mission-critical fragments
- if this knowledge is very important and your learning process overflows with articles to read, extract-preview will increase your exposure to the article
- if the article is not very interesting, line-at-a-time reading will be equivalent to assigning a lower [priority](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) (you will just read a sentence once per week or once per month and you may never finish the article unless it gets more relevant or interesting)
- if you believe the article contains very important pieces in its body, you may want to quickly locate these and extract them for separate (more detailed) reading
- if your reviews occur in very long [intervals](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) as a result of slow reading, you may opt for shortening the interval or running a preview of the most important sections instead
- if you are reading texts from your e-mail [tasklist](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Tasklist), preview is highly recommended: not all people start their messages with the most important points and you certainly would not want to delay locating paragraphs requiring immediate action with weeks of delay
- if you import from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/), high priority articles can be split automatically (with **Split: Split the article** in the **[Commander](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Commander)**), and you can assign [priorities](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) to individual subsections

In summary, these are the most important incentives for the whole-article preview:

- high priority of the material
- indication of higher-priority fragments buried in a lower-priority text
- high interest

## Unified store of knowledge

SuperMemo should conglomerate all your knowledge and your learning material. Ideally, you should just keep a single body of knowledge in a single [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection). That main collection should be enriched daily by new imports of articles and multimedia from various sources. Keeping your knowledge in a single [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) is vital for [subset review](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning), searching for knowledge and references, searching for pictures, statistics, progress monitoring, import defaults, etc. SuperMemo provides a rich set of tools for handling disparate areas of knowledge in a single continuous learning process. However, in certain situations, you may create separate [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) for various purposes. There are two main reasons for keeping [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) separate:

1. collections that are not part of your lifelong learning, and
2. collections that need special treatment due to various technical limitations imposed by SuperMemo or current technology.

Here are some examples of situations that justify creating [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) separate from your main body of knowledge:

- project collections ([problem solving](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_problem_solving), [tasklists](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Tasklist), creative elaboration): those [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) serve a specific project, not your general learning. After the project is complete, they may either be archived or integrated with the main body of knowledge (depending on their nature).
- [incremental writing](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_writing) projects, blogs, etc.
- [incremental problem solving](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_problem_solving) [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) dedicated to a specific problem where you want to focus entirely on a single issue
- picture [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) (public: family albums; private: family picture collections, etc.): if your picture database goes into hundreds of thousands of pictures, you will definitely want to keep it separate for easy backup and dedicated processing, which will often be of different nature than learning
- YouTube video collections: learning with [YouTube](http://youtube.com/) is quite different from [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), you cannot play your favorite music while learning with videos, you may give up learning when you have no access to the Internet, etc.
- video file collections (e.g. home video): those [collections](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) will usually call for different processing. In addition, they quickly grow into terabytes in size, which discourages frequent backups
- diaries and journals
- logs
- jukebox: incremental learning process can add an extra level of fun to experiencing music. Only after playing with a jukebox.kno for a few weeks you will truly understand how important [priorities](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority) and [intervals](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) are in the perception of music!
- mail: you may want to separate business from family&friends and from the mail related to the current project
- [tasklists](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Tasklist) and charts
- paper notes
- kid's [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection): if your kids are too young to do SuperMemo on their own
- notes: on occasion you may prefer to keep your notes in SuperMemo rather than a word processor (e.g. easier startup, collection switching, better search, etc.)
- audio archive, and more

## Flow of knowledge

The figure below roughly illustrates the flow of knowledge in time depending on knowledge difficulty:

[![SuperMemo: Time flow of knowledge in the learning process](https://help.supermemo.org/images/thumb/8/82/Repetitions_graph.png/800px-Repetitions_graph.png)](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Repetitions_graph.png)

> ***Figure**: The horizontal axis corresponds with the repetition number and the vertical axis represents [intervals](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) (logarithmic scale). Despite a popular belief, the semi-log scale does not produce a linear graph here. Clearly the increase in the length of intervals slows down with successive repetitions. Moreover, the graph corresponding with zero [lapses](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse) (red curve), results from the superposition of [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) with lower and faster increase in [intervals](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) (determined by [difficulty](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Difficulty)). The bell-shaped curve is determined by all contributing [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item) (below repetition number 10) and then only by difficult items or items with low [forgetting index](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index) for which the increase in the length of [intervals](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval) is significantly slower (above repetition 10). To see the above graph in your own [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection), use **[Tools](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu#Tools) : Repetitions graph** on the [browser menu](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu)*

## Incremental reading of PDF articles

PDF is a proprietary format. SuperMemo does not support PDF natively. This has always made PDF materials harder to process than ordinary HTML text imported from the web.

There are 4 approaches that are most often used to process PDF incrementally. You will need to see which one is best for your particular material. It may happen that you will need to resort to mixed strategies and use different approaches to different texts. The 4 options are:

- **[Converters](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_to_HTML_converters)**: using PDF to HTML converters to generate HTML text that can be read in SuperMemo
- **[Pictures](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_with_visual_learning)**: using page snapshots (e.g. with **Print Screen**) and employing [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning)
- **[Manual](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_copy_and_paste)**: using copy and paste to copy PDF to SuperMemo page by page (or picture by picture)
- **[Incremental](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Incremental_PDF)**: using an incremental approach to read-copy-and-paste while working with PDF in Adobe Reader called from SuperMemo

Conversion to HTML is most convenient and least expensive. However, some converters and/or some PDFs produce HTML that is quite different than the original, and/or difficult to process in SuperMemo (e.g. requiring extra filtering, or extra manual formatting). Page snapshots are a fast way to read and import pages that are difficult to convert or are read only (e.g. manuals that require a specific page layout). Copy and paste approach is best for articles that can easily be selected in their entirety and which do not contain too many pictures. Finally, the incremental approach is most natural for SuperMemo, however, instead of using [read-points](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point), the student needs to make a note where he or she stopped reading the text.

For more solutions, see: [PDF at SuperMemopedia](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF).

### PDF to HTML converters

As SuperMemo cannot host PDF files natively for [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading), the most promising long-term solution is the use of PDF to HTML converters. However, all converters have their limitations. The languages defined by HTML and PDF are not equivalent. Not all expressions of PDF can be expressed in HTML. This is why you need to check a few converters and see which one is best at processing your type of learning material.

#### Conversion

Here is a short list of converters as compiled at [SuperMemoPedia](https://supermemopedia.com/):

- [PDF to HTML converters](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_to_HTML_converters)

If you are not sure which one to choose, you might use this one: [PDF online](http://www.pdfonline.com/) (it keeps a limit of 2 MB on the size of files to convert).

#### Processing

Once texts are imported to SuperMemo, they may need further processing:

- filter problematic code with *F6* (e.g. bulletizing tables)
- import pictures (some pictures are text-like constructs that need to be snapped with copy&paste)
- split into manageable portions (e.g. with the help of **Split: Split the article** in the [**Commander**](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Commander))
- convert portions of text to plain text with *Ctrl+Shift+F12* (in cases of most unfriendly formatting)

#### Using MS Word

Some students use MS Word as an intermediary stage in conversion to HTML. However, as much as the conversion of PDF to HTML is never complete and accurate, there are differences between PDF and MS Word that make life difficult. At the moment of writing, there aren't any tools that would reliably convert PDF to MS Word format. Pasting from Adobe Reader to MS Word yields poor results (e.g. texts in columns lose or mix portions of texts). If you own MS Word, you can give it a try, however, using converters or [other methods](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Incremental_reading_of_PDF_articles) will probably work better.

#### Using OCR

Some users swear by [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition). See: [Using OCR to convert PDF for SuperMemo](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_and_OCR).

### PDF with visual learning

You can convert PDF to pictures and employ the tools of [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning).

Here are the steps:

1. convert PDF to pictures either by saving as [JPEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG), or by using page snapshots with **Print Screen**
2. [paste pictures](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning#Pasting_pictures_from_the_clipboard) to SuperMemo or [import pictures from a local drive](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning#Importing_pictures_from_a_local_drive)
3. as pictures are not searchable, it is important to copy&paste a part of article (if possible) that could later be used in [search and review](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Search_and_review). For example, abstracts of scholarly articles with necessary reference tags (*#Title*, *#Author*, *#Source*, etc.)
4. use [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning) to process the imported materials. Pictures will need to be trimmed (e.g. (1) *Alt+click*, (2) marquee selection of the interesting part, (3) press *Esc*, and (4) choose *Permanently cut/crop the zoomed/trimmed image file*). Use visual [extracts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract) (*Alt+X*) to focus on smaller portions of imported articles
5. annotate the pictures or write down summaries to further process most important portions with [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading). Without the use of [cloze deletion](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion), imported material may quickly be forgotten.

This method of reading PDF is analogous to [incremental reading of paper materials](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Incremental_reading_of_paper_articles).

See more at [SuperMemoPedia](https://supermemopedia.com/): [PDF and Visual Learning](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_and_Visual_Learning).

### PDF copy and paste

If [conversion of PDF to HTML](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_to_HTML_converters) is not satisfactory, you may need to resort to old plain copy&paste. Some PDF texts paste whole chapters pretty well with little extra text/code (e.g. page headings). Some PDFs respond well to *Ctrl+A* (for selecting all text) and **Copy with Formatting** (right click). Usually, Adobe Reader will not let you do multi-page selections that would paste to SuperMemo fast and nicely. You may even get annoyed with your attempts to copy a multi-column portion of a single page. You will get one column selected, middle of the second, and the ending of the third. Other double-column texts will paste as a mix of both columns per line. Sometimes pasting multi-column texts is not possible. This means that you will often need to go from page to page, or even column to column, and repeat copy&paste. That can take ages. Similarly, pictures do not copy as part of HTML. So you need to copy&paste pictures separately. Here again, when Adobe Reader will not let you copy pictures easily, you can just use **Print Screen**, paste to SuperMemo and trim&crop in SuperMemo (see: [Visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_with_visual_learning)). Tables are usually best processed in the form of pictures as they usually import poorly to HTML. Some PDF documents do not even allow of selecting texts. In those cases you will need to resort to [PDF visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_with_visual_learning) too. Sometimes you may just give up and read the article straight without bothering to do it incrementally, or look for alternative texts, or just give up reading altogether. You can also read the article using traditional methods, and copy to SuperMemo only the portions that you would normally extract within SuperMemo.

After pasting text from Adobe Reader to SuperMemo, it will often be jagged, disrupted, wrongly formatted, etc. Converting short passages to plain text often dramatically improves readability. The shortcut is *Ctrl+Shift+F12*.

### Incremental PDF

If you want to work incrementally with PDF articles, you can use the following strategy:

1. Save your PDF files to a dedicated folder
2. Import them regularly with **[File](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu) : [Import](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu#Import) : Files and folders**
3. Define a PDF [template](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Template) with a large [HTML component](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/HTML_component) and a tiny binary [component](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Component) for holding PDF (use that template as the default for the import [concept group](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept_group), or apply it after import to all PDF articles)
4. When reading is scheduled for the PDF element, click the binary [component](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Component) and jump to the page where you last finished reading (to automatically go back to the last viewed pages, in Adobe Reader, check **Edit : Preferences : Documents : Restore last view settings when reopening documents**)
5. Paste all important fragments of the PDF document to the [HTML component](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/HTML_component) (if texts cannot be selected, use the **Print Screen** option, paste the picture, and use [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning) tools to extract individual fragments)
6. Paste figures to SuperMemo by clicking a selected picture, right-clicking, and choosing **Copy Image** in Adobe Reader or **Print Screen**. Use [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning) tools to process larger pictures (trimming, zooming, extracting, etc.)
7. Process the pasted texts in parallel with reading the PDF document (esp. if they are very important). Alternatively, start [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) in HTML only when you finish reading the document in PDF

## Incremental reading of paper articles

If you have many notes taken from paper journals, or you must read paper articles, you can use a few methods to employ [incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading) in that process. Working with paper will never be as effective as working with electronic material. However, you can still triple your performance with the benefits of incremental learning.

Here is an exemplary algorithm for processing paper notes:

1. before getting down to processing, search the net! Many noteworthy articles have already been published online. That saves lots of time
2. if the text is of general nature, you might find a better equivalent (e.g. at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/))
3. create a dedicated *PaperNotes.kno* [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) for easy backup. It might grow to a huge size! You can use a dedicated processing time slot for your paper notes
4. very short notes or very important notes, you can type by hand. The advantage of typing is that it can shorten the texts, give them more meaning, and have them instantly searchable in the [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection)
5. the rest of texts you can import as pictures or process with [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (e.g. use a pen scanner to pick the most valuable pieces from the book)
6. use a digital camera to quickly snap paper pages. A scanner yields better quality but is too slow
7. copy the pics to the hard disk
8. use **[File](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu) : [Import](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu#Import) : Files and folders** to import all pictures at once
9. use [visual learning](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning) and the tools of incremental learning to prioritize and process the imported material (the **Extract** option is particularly useful)

A user of SuperMemo wrote a few words about his experience with [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) in [Studying Law with SuperMemo](http://www.super-memory.com/articles/users/zmuda.htm).
