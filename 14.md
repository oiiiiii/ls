**Neural creativity** is creativity induced with the help of neural review. In neural review, SuperMemo successively feeds the user with knowledge associated with a selected topic or a chosen subset of topics. When a network of conceptual [links](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link) connects areas of knowledge, they form semantic space that can be explored in a neural manner that helps forming new associations, and generate ideas. This process is conducive to research, invention, problem solving, etc. Metaphorically speaking, neural creativity helps emulate a thinking process in a human brain extended by knowledge stored in SuperMemo.

Neural creativity employs the incremental learning process to produce new ideas in a neural fashion. In neural creativity, closely related [concepts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept) are more likely to show up when executing a neural review of a studied subject. If you are fluent in incremental learning, you may wonder how a neural review differs from a [semantic review](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Semantic_review). The main difference is that in semantic review the whole burden of juggling the semantics is in your hands. You need to know the tools of incremental learning to execute a [semantic review](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Semantic_review) well. In neural review, the whole process will be reduced to pressing a single button in SuperMemo.

Unlike it is the case with semantic review in SuperMemo, or simply googling for knowledge, the whole process of associating pieces of knowledge is automated. To give it a try, pick a subject and **Go neural** (*Ctrl+F2*).

## Incremental approach

Incremental learning can be used to creatively come up with new ideas. This raises some skepticism. Here is an exemplary skeptical voice:

> *"How can interruption be good for creativity or problem solving? Isn't it that all great discoveries come from continual, persistent and focused effort? It is those who can dedicate themselves to a cause that achieve best results. Most people fail because they major in minor things. They do many things superficially. They are jacks of all trade and masters of none. Incremental learning seems like an effort to major in everything. Putting too much on one's own plate".*

This question keeps popping back in various contexts. Here is an illustrative answer based on the fact that creativity and problem solving are based on forming new connections in your brain.

**Incremental recall: bringing back things to memory, piece by piece**

Imagine you had a very eventful day. For example, a visit to an exotic city, meeting an old good friend, or attending a breakthrough conference. Imagine that your inspiration is so rich that you want to write a detailed report of the day (assuming you did not capture it all with [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass)). The first thing to do is to sit down to writing a report and list all essential keywords for rebuilding the memory of the day. Once you write the outline, you can quickly notice that it does not take long before you come up blank for new memories. You cannot recall any more details. This is normal. Sitting down over a blank piece of paper for an hour may not be the best use of your time. It may be pretty unproductive. However, if you keep your piece of paper handy, you may notice that it keeps filling up with new memories as they keep popping up in your head in different contexts. An image, a smell, or an article in press may all contribute to unexpected recall. If you happen to execute incremental learning in the meantime, you will notice that the process of recall is intensified. If your learning materials are rich, you are likely to read about dozens of unrelated subjects in a single day. All those subjects produce new associations. Your blank piece of paper will fill up much faster than it is the case in the course of ordinary life or if your learning was less varied. What you witness here is incremental recall.

There is a short step from incremental recall to incremental creativity. Both are based on incrementally building a mental structure in your mind. In case of recall, you will recover past memories. In case of creativity, you will additionally add

1. new pieces of knowledge acquired via incremental learning (e.g. neural review), and
2. new memories and/or ideas you have not experienced or thought of before.

Finally, in problem solving, you will direct this creative process towards accomplishing a specific task: solving a problem, answering a question, etc.

## Examples of neural creativity

Neural tools in SuperMemo equip the user with a sort of Einstein's brain in slow motion. You can build a brain of knowledge as big as you wish. You can make your networks of ideas as complex as you wish. And then you can just press one button to start a train of thought at your own pace while watching all new ideas form in front of your eyes. Here are some examples of the neural approach in SuperMemo:

### Medical diagnosis

Physicians and medical students always have a mountain of new health-related knowledge to process. This is also true of all individuals who care about health. A specific problem to solve, e.g. a medical diagnosis, may also be a good excuse for acquiring new knowledge neural style. For example, if a patient presents with a skin condition, a dedicated [concept](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept) might be created (e.g. *Patient John Doe condition*). [Conceptual links](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link) can then be made to relevant fields of knowledge, e.g. skin conditions, allergies, bacterial skin infections, mycoses, etc. Neural review will provide new inspiration for new areas to explore. Two birds can be killed with one stone:

1. new knowledge acquired for future use, and
2. zeroing in on the ultimate diagnosis.

### Solving a software problem

Neural review has already been helpful in solving problems that pester users of SuperMemo (e.g. [misaligned cloze deletion](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Cloze_deletions_get_shifted_by_one_character), due to bugs in Internet Explorer). When a pesky problem shows up, all related knowledge can be associated with a [concept](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept) that defines the problem (e.g. *cloze bug*).

In the case of the "cloze bug", several users sent their ideas on how to possibly solve the problem. None of these worked. In the end, all [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)-related ideas turned out to be a blind path. However, initiating neural review provided an ultimate incentive with a hope for a light in the tunnel. Could the problem be solved without neural review? Yes. Perhaps, neural review helped step out of the box in looking for solutions? If not, it might at least have had a psychological effect: *"if nothing works, perhaps neural review will?"*.

### Creative writing

[Incremental writing](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_writing) is useful if you want to compile a number of texts into a larger body. Neural approach may be useful if you want to combine that procedure with a degree of research. You may either want to research a topic (e.g. when looking for facts or literature related to your thesis), or research your own texts if they are too voluminous and highly repetitive (e.g. to look for simpler phrasing, more logical sequencing, clearer line of thought, etc.).

### Forensic science

Forensics is an excellent example of where neural approach may appear useful. A complex case may involve a great deal of case-specific knowledge that needs to be combined with scientific and general knowledge. Wherever the size of knowledge goes well beyond the capacity of human memory, and where the solution may require thinking "out of the box", neural approach may act as an extension to the human mind. Once a case is solved, case-independent knowledge may be integrated with the main learning [collection](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection) to secure the long-term investment in knowledge.
