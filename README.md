Two separate memories should be separated in SuperMemo due to the fact that they nearly always will require different timing of repetitions. 
If you can always activate the same mental pathway in thinking about the Council of Trent ("neurons firing together" in the same pattern), your particular item has a good chance of surviving long in the process without a memory lapse. 

However, once you build a large database of similar items, and you review your sizeable material under the pressure of time, your review will always tend to strip redundant pieces of information. 

Overtime, your nice item will be reduced to the bare bones of information that will often fail its primary test: applicability in real life. 

It may happen, that despite zero memory lapses, in 2-3 years, someone will ask you about a Council of Trent in a new context and you will be amazed that you won't be able to reasonably answer the question despite having all the necessary pieces of information included in your item. 

Two memories of different difficulty might be compared to two different planes of different flying characteristics. 

The difficult piece (e.g. 18 year duration of the Council) might be compared to a slow flying plane. 

The easy piece (here the reference to the Catholic Church) might be compared to a modern jet. 

Review of the conglomerated item might be compared to flying both planes at the same speed. 

In an extreme case, this might be impossible. The compromise speed might be too high for a slow plane, which might disintegrate beyond a certain speed limit, while the faster plane cannot slow down enough without stalling. 

In our memory, forgetting is equivalent to forgetting, while stalling is caused by the spacing effect. 

By doing complex and repeatable reasoning at each repetition, you might act as if handling both planes using remote control. 

However, this is always difficult and requires lots of focus and deliberation at repetitions. 

Your brain has natural defenses against such "enforced repetitive reasoning". 

It is designed to be "intellectually lazy" and thus energetically efficient. 

Practice shows that incremental reading produces many more items. 

However, those items are usually much easier to remember. 

In the end, you spend less time on reviewing 5-10 items than you would spend on an item that would conglomerate information and suffer repeated memory lapses or very short intervals.
